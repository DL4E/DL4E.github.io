Einstein once said
>"The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience"

I'm supposed to do that, and I do, only that sometimes I dont.
and this is the result.

Enjoy.
